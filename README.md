This is a simplified version of the cosmos odyssey project.

## Features:

- Lacks MUI (makes it unecessarily colorful)
- Very minimalist, barebones design
- No "AI-slop" code that comes from constant fixes
- No complex algorithms and recursive functions to calculate the routes
- ONLY shows straight routes that come from the API

## Possible additions
- Currently everything runs on the front-end and stores JSON data locally. 
- Additional possible sorting etc. could be done with SQL.

## To run:
- Clone the repo
- Go to the SimpleOdyssey directory `cd SimpleOdyssey`
- Install dependencies `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`
